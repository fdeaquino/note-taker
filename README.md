# Note Taker

## Description
This web application allows users to take notes, save them, and delete them as they please. 

Although the front-end had already been created, my challenge was to build the back-end by creating a server, connecting it to the front-end, and deploying the application to Heroku. My biggest obstacle was creating the DELETE api route, which required additional research. In the end, the DELETE api route was created and tested with successful results.
